/* alignof (TYPE), also known as _Alignof (TYPE), yields the alignment
   requirement of a structure member (i.e., slot or field) that is of
   type TYPE, as an integer constant expression.

   This differs from GCC\'s and clang\'s __alignof__ operator, which can
   yield a better-performing alignment for an object of that type.  For
   example, on x86 with GCC and on Linux/x86 with clang,
   __alignof__ (double) and __alignof__ (long long) are 8, whereas
   alignof (double) and alignof (long long) are 4 unless the option
   \'-malign-double\' is used.

   The result cannot be used as a value for an \'enum\' constant, if you
   want to be portable to HP-UX 10.20 cc and AIX 3.2.5 xlc.  */

/* alignas (A), also known as _Alignas (A), aligns a variable or type

      int alignas (8) foo;
      struct s { int a; int alignas (8) bar; };

   aligns the address of FOO and the offset of BAR to be multiples of 8.

   A should be a power of two that is at least the type\'s alignment
   and at most the implementation\'s alignment limit.  This limit is
   2**28 on typical GNUish hosts, and 2**13 on MSVC.  To be portable
   to MSVC through at least version 10.0, A should be an integer
   constant, as MSVC does not support expressions such as 1 << 3.
   To be portable to Sun C 5.11, do not align auto variables to
   anything stricter than their default alignment.

   The following C23 requirements are not supported here:

     - If A is zero, alignas has no effect.
     - alignas can be used multiple times; the strictest one wins.
     - alignas (TYPE) is equivalent to alignas (alignof (TYPE)).

   Suppress extern inline with HP-UX cc, as it appears to be broken; see
   <https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-texinfo/2013-02/msg00030.html>.

   Suppress extern inline with Sun C in standards-conformance mode, as it
   mishandles inline functions that call each other.  E.g., for \'inline void f
   (void) { } inline void g (void) { f (); }\', c99 incorrectly complains
   \'reference to static identifier "f" in extern inline function\'.
   This bug was observed with Oracle Developer Studio 12.6
   (Sun C 5.15 SunOS_sparc 2017/05/30).

   Suppress extern inline (with or without __attribute__ ((__gnu_inline__)))
   on configurations that mistakenly use \'static inline\' to implement
   functions or macros in standard C headers like <ctype.h>.  For example,
   if isdigit is mistakenly implemented via a static inline function,
   a program containing an extern inline function that calls isdigit
   may not work since the C standard prohibits extern inline functions
   from calling static functions (ISO C 99 section 6.7.4.(3).
   This bug is known to occur on:

     OS X 10.8 and earlier; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2012-12/msg00023.html

     DragonFly; see
     http://muscles.dragonflybsd.org/bulk/clang-master-potential/20141111_102002/logs/ah-tty-0.3.12.log

     FreeBSD; see:
     https://lists.gnu.org/r/bug-gnulib/2014-07/msg00104.html

   OS X 10.9 has a macro __header_inline indicating the bug is fixed for C and
   for clang but remains for g++; see <https://trac.macports.org/ticket/41033>.
   Assume DragonFly and FreeBSD will be similar.

   GCC 4.3 and above with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements ISO C99
   inline semantics, unless -fgnu89-inline is used.  It defines a macro
   __GNUC_STDC_INLINE__ to indicate this situation or a macro
   __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate the opposite situation.
   GCC 4.2 with -std=c99 or -std=gnu99 implements the GNU C inline
   semantics but warns, unless -fgnu89-inline is used:
     warning: C99 inline functions are not supported; using GNU89
     warning: to disable this warning use -fgnu89-inline or the gnu_inline function attribute
   It defines a macro __GNUC_GNU_INLINE__ to indicate this situation.
